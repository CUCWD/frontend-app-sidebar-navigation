## How to contribute to the Sidebar MFE.

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

You can contribute to the Sidebar MFE in several ways. Check what types of contributions we accept before making changes.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations about ideas, features, requirements or simply a topic that needs to be discussed before diving into any code detail.

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has not yet been assigned, you should not start working on it.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Pearson-Advance/frontend-app-sidebar-navigation/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Pearson-Advance/frontend-app-sidebar-navigation/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem (or links to the original issue) and solution.

* Ensure that the PR meets the criteria mentioned in the [resource section](#resources).


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure that the PR meets the criteria mentioned in the [resource section](#resources).

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by openening a new [idea discussion](https://github.com/Pearson-Advance/frontend-app-sidebar-navigation/discussions/new?category=ideas)

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## Make Changes

### Make changes locally

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone your fork and follow the Readme instructions to set up this MFE.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Ensure that the PR meets the criteria mentioned in the [resource section](#resources).
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- Keep your changes up to date with the changes in the target branch, you can use the [rebase command](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase) to update your branch.
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- When your PR is ready to be merged, we will take care of that.

### Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs).
  * We use React + Redux.
  * This is open source project. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
  * It's also important for code readability:
    * Add [trailing commas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas).
    * Add the necessary documentation and doc-strings following the patterns of the current project.
    * Check the changes for any grammatical or spelling problems.
